                <h3>Kali Linux</h3>
                <p> <b>Kali Linux is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed 
                    for digital forensics and penetration testing.It is maintained
                    and funded by Offensive Security.</b> 
                    Kali Linux has approximately 600 penetration-testing programs 
                    (tools), including Armitage (a graphical cyber attack management tool),
                    Nmap (a port scanner), Wireshark (a packet analyzer), metasploit
                    (penetration testing framework), John the Ripper (a password cracker),
                    sqlmap (automatic SQL injection and database takeover tool), Aircrack-ng
                    (a software suite for penetration-testing wireless LANs), Burp suite and 
                    OWASP ZAP web application security scanners,etc.
                    It was developed by Mati Aharoni and Devon Kearns of Offensive Security through the 
                    rewrite of BackTrack, their previous information security testing
                    Linux distribution based on Knoppix. The name was inspired by 
                    the Hindu goddess Kali.
                    Kali Linux is based on the Debian Testing branch. Most 
                    packages Kali uses are imported from the Debian repositories.
