        <h1>What is parallax scrolling?</h1>
        <p>
            Parallax scrolling is a computer graphics technique used by web 
            designers to create a faux-3D effect. As users scroll down a 
            webpage, different layers of content or backgrounds move at 
            different speeds, and this creates an optical illusion. Using
             parallax scrolling is not a new technique. In the early 1980s, 
             game designers working on Super Mario Bros. used parallax 
             graphics to create a sensation of depth.
             <br> Today, parallax scrolling has become more of a trend in the
                 web design world—and for good reason. Scrolling is easier
                  than clicking, and a well-designed parallax effect engages 
                  users to scroll for more information.

        <h1>How do I make a parallax website design?</h1>
        <p>
            There are a few different ways designers can create parallax website designs.
             The first is to dive into pure CSS to create it. If you want to follow this 
             approach, you should use a container element and add a background image to 
             this container. Then you should use the “background-attachment: fixed” CSS
              property to create the actual parallax effect. You can find a working 
              example at W3Schools.
              Another approach is to use website builders to add parallax scrolling. 
              Website builders like Wix, Elementor, or Squarespace allow you to create 
              a parallax effect with minimal effort.

        <h1>Engage visitors with parallax scrolling effects</h1>
        <p>
            Parallax scrolling gives web designers a unique opportunity 
            to introduce a sense of depth into their design to keep 
            visitors engaged. Well-crafted parallax website designs can
            easily help you stand out from the crowd and create a lasting
            impression for your visitors.
